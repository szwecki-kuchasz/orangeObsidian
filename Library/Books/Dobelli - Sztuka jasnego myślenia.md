While this may seem like a kind gesture, it is important to consider the potential consequences of accepting a free drink. **The Reciprocity Bias** One reason why people may offer to buy you a drink is because of the reciprocity bias. This bias suggests that people feel obligated to return a favor or kindness that has been shown to them. By offering to buy you a drink, someone may be hoping that you will feel obligated to reciprocate in some way. **The Dangers of Accepting Free Drinks** While it may seem harmless to accept a free drink, there are several potential dangers to consider. For example, the drink could be spiked with drugs or other substances, which could lead to serious health risks. Additionally, accepting a drink from a stranger could make you more vulnerable to other forms of harm, such as theft or assault. **Conclusion** While it may be tempting to accept a free drink, it is important to consider the potential risks. By being aware of the reciprocity bias and the dangers of accepting free drinks, you can make informed decisions and stay safe in social situations.

The internet is particularly susceptible to this bias, as we tend to read news sites and blogs that already align with our values. The document is warning against relying on self-help and get-rich-quick books, which often use cherry-picked evidence to support their claims.||The confirmation bias is the mother of all misconceptions. It is the tendency to interpret new information so that it becomes compatible with our existing theories, beliefs, and convictions. Self-help and get-rich-quick books are further examples of blinkered storytelling. Their shrewd authors collect piles of proof to pump up the most banal of theories, such as “meditation is the key to happiness.” Internet is particularly fertile ground for the confirmation bias.

The author argues that this bias can lead us to prefer having a wrong map to having no map at all, because having some information is often better than having no information.||The availability bias says this: We create a picture of the world using the examples that most easily come to mind.

We can aptly describe it as the “I told you so” phenomenon: In retrospect, everything seems clear and inevitable. So why is the hindsight bias so perilous? Well, it makes us believe we are better predictors than we actually are, causing us to be arrogant about our knowledge and consequently to take too much risk. Overcoming the hindsight bias is not easy. Studies have shown that people who are aware of it fall for it just as much as everyone else. So, I’m very sorry, but you’ve just wasted your time reading this chapter. If you’re still with me, I have one final tip, this time from personal rather than professional experience: Keep a journal. Write down your predictions—for political changes, your career, your weight, the stock market, and so on. Then, from time to time, compare your notes with actual developments. You will be amazed at what a poor forecaster you are.|

This cognitive bias can have detrimental effects in various aspects of life, including financial decision-making, interpersonal relationships, and career development. ## Examples of Overconfidence - Johann Sebastian Bach composed over 1,100 works that survived to this day, but he may have composed even more that are now lost. Despite this, many people underestimate the number of works he composed. - In surveys, a high percentage of people tend to rate themselves as above-average in various domains, including love-making. - Even professionals can fall prey to the overconfidence effect. For example, a survey of faculty at the University of Nebraska found that 68 percent rated themselves in the top 25 percent for teaching ability. ## Conclusion The overconfidence effect can lead to poor decision-making and inaccurate self-assessments. It is important to be aware of this bias and take steps to mitigate its effects.|||

It includes a story about Max Planck's chauffeur giving a lecture on quantum mechanics and a quote from Charlie Munger about staying within one's circle of competence. The bias described is "Chauffeur Knowledge."||After receiving the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918, Max Planck went on tour across Germany. Wherever he was invited, he delivered the same lecture on new quantum mechanics. Over time, his chauffeur grew to know it by heart: “It has to be boring giving the same speech each time, Professor Planck. How about I do it for you in Munich? You can sit in the front row and wear my chauffeur’s cap. That’d give us both a bit of variety.” Planck liked the idea, so that evening the driver held a long lecture on quantum mechanics in front of a distinguished audience. Later, a physics professor stood up with a question. The driver recoiled: “Never would I have thought that someone from such an advanced city as Munich would ask such a simple question! **My chauffeur will answer it.”** One of Munger’s best pieces of advice is: “You have to stick within what I call your **circle of competence**. You have to know what youunderstand and what you don’t understand. It’s not terribly important how big the circle is. But it is terribly important that you know where the perimeter is.” True experts recognize the limits of what they know and what they do not know. If they find themselves outside their circle of competence, they keep quiet or simply say, “I don’t know.”|

Or can we? The button’s real purpose is to make us believe we have an influence on the traffic lights, and thus we’re better able to endure the wait for the signal to change with more patience. The same goes for “door-open” and “door-close” buttons in elevators: Many are not even connected to the electrical panel. Such tricks are also designed in open-plan offices: For some people it will always be too hot, for others, too cold. Clever technicians create the illusion of control by installing fake temperature dials. This reduces energy bills—and complaints. Such ploys are called “placebo buttons” and they are being pushed in all sorts of realms.|

Chapter number: 36 Processed: Yes Bias name: Fundamental Attribution Error In this passage, the author suggests that humans are inherently social creatures who focus much of their attention on others.
