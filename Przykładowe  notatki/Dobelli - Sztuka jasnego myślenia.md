Here are some brief descriptions of the cognitive biases mentioned in the summary of "The Art of Thinking Clearly" by Ralf Dobelli:

- **The Sunk Cost Fallacy**: The tendency to continue investing in a project or decision based on past investments, even if it no longer makes sense. For example, continuing to invest time and money in a failing business because you've already invested so much.
- **Confirmation Bias**: The tendency to seek out and interpret information that confirms one's existing beliefs, while ignoring or discounting evidence that contradicts them. For example, only seeking out news sources that align with your political views.
- **The Narrative Fallacy**: The tendency to create narratives or stories to explain random events or coincidences. For example, believing that a lucky charm brought you good luck instead of acknowledging that it was just a coincidence.
- **The Halo Effect**: The tendency to make broad judgments based on a single trait or characteristic. For example, assuming that someone who is physically attractive must also be intelligent or competent.
- **The Outcome Bias**: The tendency to judge decisions based on their outcomes, rather than the quality of the decision-making process. For example, assuming that a successful businessperson made all the right decisions, even if some of those decisions were actually risky or poorly thought out.
- **The Overconfidence Effect**: The tendency to overestimate one's own abilities or the accuracy of one's predictions. For example, believing that you're a better driver than you actually are.
- **The Hindsight Bias**: The tendency to view past events as more predictable than they actually were. For example, believing that you knew all along that a stock was going to plummet, even if you didn't actually predict it.
- **The Negativity Bias**: The tendency to give more weight to negative experiences or information than positive ones. For example, focusing more on a single negative review of your product than on multiple positive reviews.
- **The Self-Serving Bias**: The tendency to attribute one's successes to personal factors and one's failures to external factors. For example, taking all the credit for a successful project, but blaming others when a project fails.
- **The Gambler's Fallacy**: The belief that the likelihood of an event occurring is affected by previous events, even if they are unrelated. For example, believing that a roulette wheel is "due" to land on black because it has landed on red several times in a row.
- **Groupthink**: The tendency to conform to group norms or beliefs, even if they are incorrect or irrational. For example, going along with a group decision even if you don't agree with it.
- **The Availability Heuristic**: The tendency to judge the likelihood of an event based on how easily it comes to mind. For example, overestimating the likelihood of a shark attack after watching a news report about one.
- **The Anchor Effect**: The tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information encountered when making decisions. For example, assuming that a used car is a good deal because it's priced lower than other used cars you've seen.
- **The Planning Fallacy**: The tendency to underestimate the time and resources needed to complete a project or task. For example, assuming that you can finish a project in a week when it will actually take a month.
- **The Herd Instinct**: The tendency to follow the actions and beliefs of a group, rather than thinking independently. For example, buying a certain brand of clothing because everyone else is wearing it.
